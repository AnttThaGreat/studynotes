Exit codes are used to check for a non zero exit code and take action.
For example, a script to run at midnight and fails with a non zero exit code 
a another action can be set to occur. ie: email the sys admin
 $?  is the system variable that holds the exit code of the script.

#!/bin/bash

package=htop

sudo apt install $package  (>> package_install_results.log  is used to print results to a log directory or file)  to help clean up 

if [ $? -eq 0 ]

then

echo "success"

echo "its here"

which $package

else

echo "it failed"

fi
_____
Command take into account the exit code and display the appropriate response. 


When trying to differentiate between exit codes, be sure to include the check after the command in question and before the next one. for example: after the if statement and before the echo.

when testing, be sure to run test in success and in faliure to make sure the exit codes show appropriately

/ adding _exit_ + an interger 
at the end of a script forces, exits the script immediately and exits with the forced code

#### uses that come to mind:
activating other scripts discreetly. 
sending specific exit codes depending on the outcomes of if statements/
